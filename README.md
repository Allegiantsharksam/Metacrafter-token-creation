# Create a Token on Solidity

The MyToken smart contract is a simple implementation of an ERC-20 like token in Solidity. 
It allows for the creation and management of a custom token with the following features:

1. Custom Token Details: Set the token name, abbreviation, and initial supply at the time of deployment.
2. Minting Tokens: Increase the total supply by creating new tokens and assigning them to a specific address.
3. Burning Tokens: Decrease the total supply by destroying tokens from a specific address, provided the address 
   has a sufficient balance.
